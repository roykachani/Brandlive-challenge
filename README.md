# Brandlive Challenge

## Description

Please prepare a JavaScript script that will create an object, where, after entering the product page (any online store), it will save its configuration (url, photo, name, prices, etc.) in the localStorage browser memory. There may be several products in this this object, depending on how many products the user visits. The script should run on the product page after typing it into the browser console. Please, send us the script and the website youâ€™ve been working on.

Visit page to run the script [Click!](https://www.venex.com.ar/)

## Getting started

    1 Visit a product in the online store.
    2 Open the browser console and type the script in the index.js file.
    3 Execute the script.
    4 Check the localStorage in application info with key "productsVisited".
